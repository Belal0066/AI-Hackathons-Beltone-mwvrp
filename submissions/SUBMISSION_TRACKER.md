## Quick Reference

**Metrics Key:**
- S1-S6: Score per scenario (lower is better)
- Total Points: Sum of all scenario points
- Mean Score: Average score across scenarios (lower is better)
- Cost: Total operational cost
- Fulfillment: Percentage of orders fulfilled

**Strategy Key:**
- **Pathfinding**: Algorithm used for route finding
- **Distance**: Method for calculating distances
- **Data Access**: How solver accesses environment data
- **Robustness**: Error handling and edge case management
- **Extensibility**: How easy to modify/extend the solver

**Scoring Formula:**
```
ScenarioScore = YourCost + BenchmarkCost √ó (100 ‚àí Fulfillment%)
Lower scores are better!
```
